# Markowitz Efficient Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project explores the concept of the Markowitz Efficient Portfolio, focusing on evaluating the statistical properties of daily log returns of equity indices and applying Markowitzâ€™s portfolio optimisation framework. 
The analysis was conducted using R and is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of portfolio optimisation techniques.

## Key Concepts

- Markowitz Efficient Portfolio: A portfolio optimisation technique that aims to maximise returns for a given level of risk by selecting asset weights.
- Gaussian Process for Returns: Statistical assessment of whether the equity index returns follow a normal distribution.
- Efficient Frontier: The set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk.
